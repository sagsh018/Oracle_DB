ORDBMS
======
Object-Relational Database management system

Table
=====
1) basic storage of data in RDBMS

Data Model
==========
1) Conceptual tool to describe the data
2) In database we have ERM (entitiy relation model)
3) ERM consist of 3 parts :
    a) Entity : Table name. ex : Student, teachers, classes
    b) Attributes : Column names ex: student_name, Student_id
    c) Relationship : A specific column or more then one column that define the relation between two tables. For example
        suppose we have two tables student and department then the relationship between them would be:
            Student "enrols" for department. So here enroll is relation between student and department table and such 
            column or columns are called as foreign keys.
4) Entity --> They are singular and unique names.
                Always in uppercase
                represented with soft box
                Synonym in paranthesis.
5) Attribute --> Singular name      
                Lowercase
                Mandatory marked with "*" sign 
                Optional Attributes are marked with "o"
6) Consider two entities 
        EMPLOYEE                        DEPARTMENT
        =================               ============
        #*  number                      #*  number 
        *   name                        *   names
        o   job title                   o   location
    Now these two entities(tables) above has
        a) Unique identifier (number) whic is a primary key and marked with "#*"
        b) Note that secondary key is marked with "#"
        c) name on both the sides is just an attribute and marked with "*"
        d) job title and location are optional attributes and mared with "o"
        e) and also note that there is a relation between two tables that is    
            i) EMPLOYEE "assigned to" DEPPARTMENT
            ii) DEPARTMENT "composed of" EMPLOYEE
        f) Also note that this relation is many to one, that means Multiple employee can assigned to 1 department
            but multiple department can't be taken by one employee, hence this is many to one relation from employee
            to department.
        g) In this case primary key (number), is also a foreign key, that can obtain relation between two tables and 
            can also result to join of two tables.
7) Consider the following tables

    EMPLOYEE
    =========
    EMP_ID  FNAME   LNAME   DPT_ID
    ==============================
    100     steven  king    90      
    101     Neena   Kochar  90
    102     Lex     de-ma   90
    103     Alex    Huun    60
    104     Bruce   loc     60
    107     Diana   Loretz  60
    124     kevin   Mour    50
    141     trenna  raj     50
    142     curtis  davis   50  

    Now here,
        a) EMP_ID is primary key hence (*#EMP_ID)
        b) DPT_ID is  foreign key
    
    DEPARTMENT
    ==========
    DPT_ID  DPT_NAME    MANAGER_ID  LOC_ID
    =======================================
    10      admin       100         1700
    20      market      200         1800
    90      executive   300         1900
    50      shipping    400         2500
    60      IT          500         2400
    110     Accounting  Null        1700
    Now here we have below
        a) DPT_ID is primary key, which is also there in EMPLOYEE as well, hence it is a foreign key. This is going
            to establish the relation between these two tables.
    
    IMP POINTS about Primary key and foreign key
    =============================================
    a) Primary key should be unique
    b) primary key canno have duplicate values
    c) primary key generally cannot be changed
    d) primary key cannot have null values
    e) foreign key is based on data values and are purely logical pointers
    f) a forein key must match an existing primary key value or unique key value of other(DEPARTMENT) table
        otherwise it can be null
    g)
