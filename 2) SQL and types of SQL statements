1) To access Oracle data base you need SQL 
2) SQL is a structured query language to access the database 
3) To write SQL statements you need development environments like
    SQL*PLUS
    Oracle SQL developer ( This is a primary tool)


USER                    SQL Developer/SQL*PLUS                         
NAME        ==>>        ======================          ==>         Oracle Server(Having Oracle RDBMS Database)
&                       SELECT department_name
PASSWORD                FROM departments;

                        Department NAME                 <==
                        ===============
                        Admin
                        marketing
                        shipping
                        executive
                        accounting
                        contrating
So we can see from the above structure that we need user name and password in order to login to the oracle server which
contain my RDBMS and then in between we have developer environment like SQL*PLUS in order to write our SQL queries 
and obtain the data as above we have obtain the table.

4) Type of SQL statements
    a) Data Manipulation Language (DML)
        SELECT
        INSERT
        UPDATE
        DELETE
        MERGE
    b) Data Definition Language (DDL)
        CREATE
        ALTER
        DROP
        RENAME
        TRUNCATE
        COMMENT
    c) Data control Langauge (DCL)
        GRANT
        REVOKE
        ==> These are basically used by DBA's
    d) Transaction control
        COMMIT
        ROLLBACK
        SAVEPOINT
