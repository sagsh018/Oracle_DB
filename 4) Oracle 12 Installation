1) First we are going to see the cloud solution provided by oracle to work with RDBMS with installing oracle 12c
2) We just need internet connection in order to work like this

Click on Start coding now on this page
That will lead you to the page of "SQL Worksheet".
Now we will be given a user named as myuser and it will not have any table or data inside it as of now
You can go to schema section of the same page in order to see all the schema's in the online portal.

Schema is nothing but the Database User and all its objects(tables and data)

Note that when we will go to schema section we will see myschema which will be empty as of now and we can select from
drop down HR Schema in order to start leaning and our user will be provided just the read access to this HR(or
any other ready schema) in that list

Once you will select the HR schema from the drop down then you will be presented with the page having all the tables,
procedures, sequences, Views etc.

So now suppose i want to retrive the DEPARTMENT table from HR schema and want to look what all is there. We will make
user DML select query in order to do so

select *
from hr.departments;

We will write this query in SQL worksheet and get the table in the output area
